1. Lithium ion baterries
2. Solar Panel
3. Invertors
4. Switches
5. Overcharging protection circuit.

The purpose of the research will be to give metahdology 
for designing the system to implement the "The Smart Integrated Energy System using alternate Energy Sources"


---- Design
1. Collect the 1 year data for the consumer

Since the geographical condition may vary take all the data from the existing energy supplier
This will decide the usage pattern of the building.


2. From this data consider maximum value of energy usage for the purpose of battery requirements.

3. Repeat this for all the consumer in an Area/Building

4. Addition of all these maximum values of each consumer shall be added to find total power requiremnet of building or an area

5. Using this value of total power you will decide type of battery
bank specification in terms of Voltage and Ampere Hours

6. Once this is decided. This data will be used to find suitable solar panel
and wind energy system which can provide the power required we will consider the 
overdrive usage factor of 1.5   

7. Reverse Selling of Energy to other consumers or global suppliers.
For example: A consumer is going outside and he/she knows that 
Its ok to use less battery 
 
--- Solar Energy patterns. 
-- Solar Tracking device.
-- Wind Energy Tracking device.
--  Since Wind energy is not predectible  

The hardware implementation will not be part of the project as it requires special expertise.
